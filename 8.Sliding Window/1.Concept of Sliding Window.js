// Whenever we have to find out a specific part in an array such as a specific subarray or a specific 
// substring part in a string based on some conditions then sliding window is used such as:

// Find the subarray of size 4 whose sum is maximum
// Find the substring which appear more than 1 time and make the whole string
// Find the longest substring with no matching characters

// In these cases we make a window and slide it on the array or string
// In first case we have a window of fix size but in 2nd or 3rd case the window size is not fix
